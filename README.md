## 📖 What is an Operating System?
An **Operating System (OS)** is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. 

### 🎯 Key Functions of an OS:
- **Process Management:** Controls execution of programs
- **Memory Management:** Allocates and deallocates memory
- **File System Management:** Handles file storage and retrieval
- **Device Management:** Manages hardware devices via drivers
- **Security & Access Control:** Ensures system security & user authentication
- **User Interface:** Provides CLI (Command Line Interface) or GUI (Graphical User Interface)

## 🖥️ Types of Operating Systems

### 1. **Batch Operating System** 📜
   - Executes jobs in batches without user interaction.
   - Example: IBM OS/360

### 2. **Time-Sharing Operating System** ⏳
   - Allows multiple users to share system resources simultaneously.
   - Example: UNIX, Linux

### 3. **Distributed Operating System** 🌍
   - Manages multiple computers as a single system.
   - Example: Amoeba, Plan 9

### 4. **Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)** ⚡
   - Processes tasks in real-time with minimal delay.
   - Example: VxWorks, FreeRTOS

### 5. **Mobile Operating System** 📱
   - Designed for smartphones and tablets.
   - Example: Android, iOS

### 1. **Monolithic Kernel** 🏗️
   - The entire OS is one single program (e.g., Linux, UNIX).

### 2. **Microkernel** 🔬
   - Only essential services run in the kernel (e.g., QNX, Minix).

### 3. **Hybrid Kernel** 🏗️🔬
   - A mix of monolithic and microkernel (e.g., Windows NT, macOS).

### 4. **Layered Architecture** 🏛️
   - OS is divided into layers, each with a specific function.

## 🚀 Features of an OS
- **Concurrency:** Handles multiple tasks at the same time.
- **Multitasking:** Runs multiple applications simultaneously.
- **Interrupt Handling:** Manages hardware and software interrupts.
- **Virtual Memory:** Uses secondary storage as extra RAM.
- **Security & Protection:** Prevents unauthorized access.
